we can utilize aggregated data from a single piece of equipment in seven different applicationsâ€”each dedicated to a critical factor in fish quality-of-life

the seven outputs can be combined in one final Deep Learning application which represents the overall health of the farm

Aquanaut aggregates data from a single piece of equipment to generate seven unique outputs, which can be combined in one final Deep Learning application to represent the overall health of a fish farm.


Aquanaut ensures the highest quality-of-life by targeting seven critical needs.


Detect sea-lice before they spread over to the other fish. Perform interventions before critical infestation levels of sea-lice trigger a require a complete chemical flush of the entire farm.

Identify behavior anomalies associated with increased Cortisol and correlate it with recent environmental changes. Reduce stress, ensure quality-of-life, and increase meat quality.

Optimize feeding times and food delivery size for maximum efficiency. Prevent wasted costs and excess pollution while increasing population growth rates.

Estimate biomass and develop insights into quantity, size, and  weight of the current fish. 

Drive decisions related to feeding and behavioral management by leveraging live data streams.

Prevent fish frome escaping and predators entering the farm without the need for SCUBA teams. Monitor the entire enclosure 24/7 and receive alerts when signs of net deteriation occur, before a hole fully forms.


sustainably and humanity seem like the keywords here

Predict changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) and other parameters related to the water over short and long periods of time. Stabalize water quality throughout the entire farm. Reduce fish stress, increase health, and promote breeding.

                doesn&#x27;t work out -- we&#x27;ll be here for supporting you.

We make everything open source and available to the public. Advances in technology shouldn't be hidden behind paywalls and legal jargon. Feel free to make your own experiments using our products, or reach out if you want us to implement our system for you!
