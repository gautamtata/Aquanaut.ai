we can utilize aggregated data from a single piece of equipment in seven different applicationsâ€”each dedicated to a critical factor in fish quality-of-life

the seven outputs can be combined in one final Deep Learning application which represents the overall health of the farm

Aquanaut aggregates data from a single piece of equipment to generate seven unique outputs, which can be combined in one final Deep Learning application to represent the overall health of a fish farm.


Aquanaut ensures the highest quality-of-life by targeting seven critical needs.


Detect sea-lice before they spread over to the other fish. Perform interventions before critical infestation levels of sea-lice trigger a require a complete chemical flush of the entire farm.

Identify behavior anomalies associated with increased Cortisol and correlate it with recent environmental changes. Reduce stress, ensure quality-of-life, and increase meat quality.

Optimize feeding times and food delivery size for maximum efficiency. Prevent wasted costs and excess pollution while increasing population growth rates.
